Code crafting, as any other job based on knowledge, is many times more art than science. Decision making is of a huge importance, and every decision, technical or not, has many side effects. So you can’t just “measure” a developer’s output in a numerical way, it wouldn’t be fair.
Let’s start assuming you are using a version control system, as git. The simplest way would be to measure code modifications (line or file additions, deletions) and commit frequency. Many readers will be familiar to github’s contribution activities chart.
